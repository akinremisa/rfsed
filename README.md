## Receiver functions analysis and dealing with sediment effects in receiver functions.
[![python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/rf.svg)](https://python.org)




## A python package for receiver functions analysis and dealing with sediment effects 

rfsed is developed specifically to implement different techniques of **analysing receiver functions
from stations overlying sedimentary layers.** The package is **adaptable, efficient, and easy-to-use** for different analysis receiver functions
obtained from stations overlying sedimentary layers.

Receiver functions techniques implemented in rfsed are:
+ H-k stacking of Zhu and Kanamori (2000)
+ Sequential H-k stacking of Yeck et al., (2013)
+ Resonance filtering and modified H-k stacking of Yu et al., (2015)
+ H-k stacking and Waveform Fitting two-step method of Akinremi et al., (2024)
+ Analysis of the synthetic reciever functions with the above-mentioned methods.


Beside these receiver function methods, rfsed has the following features:
+ Creating publication quality figures for the results of the analysis.
+ Extracting earthquake data from local seismic record files.
+ Multiprocessing options for waveform fitting and extracting earthquake data from local seismic record files.


Receiver functions streams in the rfsed are handled by the 'RFStream' class of the [rf](https://github.com/trichter/rf) open software, and it inherits a lot of useful methods from the Obspy class 'Stream'. It is supported via the obspyh5 package. For more information on class "RFStream", see documentation on [rf](https://rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
The rf framework is included in the rfsed package for completness under The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2013-2019 Tom Eulenfeld. In the rfsed modules to extract earthquake data from local seismic records, read and write support for necessary metadata is provided for SAC, SeismicHanlder and HDF5 formats based on [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy).

The receiver function forward calculation in rfsed is done using SynR, which is modified after the [SynSeis module - seispy](https://github.com/xumi1993/seispy) project (under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE).
